## Privacy Policy

### Last Updated: July 18, 2023

Some of the best moments in life are private, shared only with your family or close friends. We’re not here for the influencer or the filtered mass market life. We’re here to keep it simple, personal and real. So naturally, privacy is important to us.
This Privacy Policy is part of the User Agreement and our Community Standards. It’s designed to make sure you know what information we collect about you, how we use it, when we share it, and the controls we provide you to manage the information you share with us. Throughout the User Agreement some words have specific meanings and they should be interpreted the same way wherever they are used.
Like the rest of the User Agreement, we cannot make you read it. But if you read it, we are sure you will learn a bit more about how we respect your information, and you’ll make our Legal team really happy!
 
### 1. Information we receive about you

When we use the term Information we mean data that may include but not be limited to personal data. 
YourLife collects information that you provide directly to us (data that you provide to us) and also through your use of our Services (data we collect when you use our Services).
 
### 1.1 Data that you provide to us

Account Creation Data: This is data that is required to create an account. Without it, we cannot provide you our Services.
- your name and a username.

Content Data: We receive Content that you create when you use our Services. This includes:
- personal preferences and travel record.

Remember, other users can copy (e.g., screenshot) your Content and share it through other services so we recommend that you do not share any Content that you do not want other people see or copy.

Communications with YourLife: When you report a concern with our Services, respond to a survey, request assistance, or exercise your rights, we receive information from you that is necessary to support you, respond to you, and improve our services.
 
### 1.2 Data we collect when you use our Services

We also receive data when you decide at your discretion to use certain features of our Services:
 
### 2. How we use information we receive about you

We would not want anyone selling our information so we do not sell your information. We use your information carefully and thoughtfully to bring you our Services. 

Our Services are brought to you through a variety of software and technical infrastructure. Understanding how these systems work is complicated and they are constantly evolving as we improve our Services. Information is often used by multiple parts of the systems to bring you even just a small feature. As a general rule the use cases YourLife makes of the information we receive falls into the following categories:

Operation, Improvement, and Provision of our Services: To create an account for you, receive and display Content, identify Content or accounts that may interest you, ensure our Services operate as you expect, and improve them.

Safety and Security: Ensure your and other users safety and security, the security of our Services, our partners, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

Measurement and Analytics: Measurement of our Services effectiveness including performance of the application (e.g., crashes and causes of crashes), and stability, your usage for recommendations of both accounts and Content.

Communications: We want to hear from you and we hope you want to hear from us so we need to use your information to communicate with you. This can happen when we need to communicate with you about a feature of our Services or when you contact us to ask a question or report Content.  

Research: We like real feedback from real users. When we do research, we let you know and you get to decide if you want to be a part of it. If you do, you will share information for research or product testing purposes.
We have published, and keep up to date, the purposes we use it for, the legal reasons for that use, and the length of time we keep that information.
 
### 3. When we share information about you

We only share your information when it’s necessary to provide you our Services or it’s required by law. That generally falls into the following categories.

Other Users: When you share Content through our Services, that Content is available to your real friends or if you share the Content more broadly to all YourLife users. 

Service Providers: To bring you our Services we work with a small group of partners who provide us services. This includes partners who help with technical and hosting support, sending notifications, publishing, and sharing content, user analytics and satisfaction surveys, management of security incidents or fraudulent activity, etc. In working with those partners, we may share your information with them to bring you our Services. 

Partner Integrations: Where we partner to bring you a feature we may need to share your information with the partner to integrate the feature into our Services. 

Legal and Statutory Purposes: From time to time we may receive legal requests for information related to our users, be required to proactively share data with authorities when we learn of certain Content on our Services (e.g., Child Sexual Abuse Material or terrorism), address fraud or security concerns, or protect people on our Services or elsewhere from harm. 

Change in Ownership. In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or bankruptcy, YourLife may share, sell or transfer information about you. This Privacy Policy would apply to all transferred information. 
 
### 4. How long do we keep information about you

Our goal is to keep your information only for as long as it’s needed to provide you our Services. Sometimes legal requirements mean that we have to keep your information for longer than our stated practices. Generally we keep your information according to the timelines below. 

Account Creation Data: retained indefinitely (i.e., as long as you have an active account) as it is required to provide and operate an account for you. If you choose to delete your account this information will be deleted.

Content Data: retained indefinitely (i.e., as long as you have an active account) or until the Content is deleted by you. 

Connection and Technical Data: retained for no longer than 24 months, however, some connection data is also part of the Account Creation Data and is kept consistent with retention periods for that data. 

Interaction Data: retained indefinitely (i.e., as long as you have an active account) or until the interaction is deleted by you. 

Usage Data: retained for no longer than 24 months.

Device and Equipment Data: retained for no longer than 24 months, however, some connection data is also part of the Account Creation Data and is kept consistent with retention periods for that data.

Content on our Services. It’s a foundational part of how YourLife works.
  
### 5. What rights do you have over your information

Privacy is a fundamental human right. That means every person that uses our Services, irrespective of where they reside, can expect the same things from us. Whether you are in Europe, one of the 50 U.S. States, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, Asia Pacific, or anywhere in between, you can:
