# Welcome to YourLife!

Making your life better is our mission. We want to build services and technologies that allow you to live your real life and share that reality with your real friends. 
To help that happen, we want to be extra clear about what it means to be part of the YourLife community. We want you to know what you can expect from us, what we expect from you, and how together we can make YourLife better for you.
To do that we created these Terms of Service (“Terms”), our Privacy Policy. If anything is unclear, or you don’t understand what we’re saying – don’t hesitate to reach out. Our goal is to maximize transparency and understanding about how YourLife works.
